## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio installed on your machine
- A device or emulator to run the app

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quiz-app.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Let Android Studio install any required dependencies.
4. Build and run the app on your device or emulator.

## Firebase Setup

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. In your Firebase project, add an Android app and follow the setup steps. You'll need the package name of your Android app.
3. Download the `google-services.json` file provided by Firebase and place it in your project's `app` directory.
4. Add the Firebase SDK to your project. Update your `build.gradle` files as follows:

**Project-level `build.gradle` (`build.gradle`)**:
    ```gradle
    buildscript {
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'  // Check for the latest version
        }
    }
    ```

**App-level `build.gradle` (`app/build.gradle`)**:
    ```gradle
    apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
    apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'

    dependencies {
        // Firebase SDK
        implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:31.1.1') // Check for the latest version
        implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-storage'
        implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth'
        implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-database'
        // Other dependencies
    }
    ```

5. Initialize Firebase in your application. Update your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`:
    ```java
    import com.google.firebase.FirebaseApp;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        FirebaseApp.initializeApp(this);
        // Other initialization code
    }
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the app to view the list of available quizzes or start a new quiz.
2. Choose a quiz from the list or start a random quiz.
3. Answer each question by selecting an option and submitting your answer.
4. View immediate feedback for each question.
5. After completing the quiz, view your final score and see which answers were correct or incorrect.
